# Automatic Installation
**IMPORTANT:** The automatic installation was tested on macOS Sonoma only - specific instructions can behave differently on other Unix & Linux distributions. The script will download this repository to your current working directory store it in a new folder called "supanuxt. Please ensure you don't have a ```supanuxt``` folder in your current working directory, to avoid any overrides of your projects!

**Initially make sure to setup your Supabase instance accordingly:**
- Login to https://supabase.com/
- Create a new Supabase project or use an existing project of your choice (in case you are using an existing project, make sure you are not using a table called ```public.profiles``` as well as a storage bucket named ```avatars```, as the script will create those, since they're needed for SupaNuxt)
- Setup your preferred auth providers (Email, Github, Facebook are currently supported within Supanuxt)
- Make sure to save your database password, as we will need it for the automatic installation!

**Now run the following commands in your terminal in your desired location:**
```bash
bash <(curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nicolaswehmeyer/supanuxt/main/install.sh)
```

That's it, you're done!ðŸš€

# Manual installation
**Initially make sure to setup your Supabase instance accordingly:**
- Login to https://supabase.com/
- Create a new Supabase project or use an existing project of your choice (in case you are using an existing project, make sure you are not using a table called ```public.profiles``` as well as a storage bucket named ```avatars```, as the script will create those, since they're needed for SupaNuxt)
- Setup your preferred auth providers (Email, Github, Facebook are currently supported within Supanuxt)
- Rename the ```.env.example``` file to ```.env```
- Insert your projects Supabase URL and API key into the ```.env``` file

Within Supabase, create a new ```public.profiles``` table, enable Row Level Security, create a new RLS policy and add a new bucket to store users profile photos.

*To do this, simply paste the following lines into the SQL editor within your Supabase project and you're done:*
```sql
-- Create a new profiles table to store users profile details
create table public.profiles (
  id uuid primary key references auth.users (id)create table public.profiles (
  id uuid primary key references auth.users (id) default auth.uid(),
  created_at timestamp with time zone default now() not null,
  firstname text,
  lastname text,
  username text,
  street text,
  postcode bigint,
  city text,
  country text,
  photo text
);

-- Enable Row-Level-Security policies
alter table public.profiles enable row level security;

-- Create a new RLS policy enabling authenticated users to CRUD their profiles
create policy "Allow authenticated users to CRUD their own profiles"
  on "public"."profiles" as permissive
  for all
  to authenticated
  using ((auth.uid() = id)) with check ((auth.uid() = id));

-- Create a new public storage bucket to store users profile photos
insert into storage.buckets
  (id, name, public, file_size_limit)
values
  ('avatars', 'avatars', true, 5242880);
```
